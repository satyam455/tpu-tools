## Rate latency tool

### Restore Payer Balances

`top-off` restores saved payer accounts to a target balance. Accounts already at
or above the target are unchanged unless `--reclaim-excess` is supplied; that
option returns surplus lamports to the authority. The authority funds deficits
and pays transaction fees, so it must have funds before running the command.

```shell
solana-rate-latency-tool -ul --authority funding.json top-off --accounts-file payers.json --balance 1SOL
solana-rate-latency-tool -ul --authority funding.json top-off --accounts-file payers.json --balance 1SOL --reclaim-excess
```

Balances accept SOL (the default unit) or LAMPORTS. The balance is the desired
total per payer, not an amount added on each run. Keep payers idle during this
operation and use rent-exempt target balances for accounts you intend to keep.
Transfers are submitted and confirmed sequentially via RPC. On an RPC error,
the command stops; earlier transfers may already have completed. Check the
failed transaction's status before rerunning after an uncertain confirmation.

Tool sends memo transactions avery `--send-interval` ms for the duration `--duration`.
Each memo has the following info: `transaction_id, generation_timestamp, target_slot`.
Optionally, tx fee might be specified.

What data we can collect from this

* `slot_latency = landed_slot - target_slot` where `landed_slot` we can get from network,
* Number of transactions being lost vs time
* `time_latency = received_timestamp - sent_timestamp` which, offcourse, includes many latencies.
* Measure txs reordering.

### Run without saving created payers (only on private cluster)

In this case tool creates accounts instantly and they are dropped after the run.
This is useful for tests on private cluster.

```rust
solana-rate-latency-tool -ul --authority config/faucet.json --validate-accounts run --duration 60 --num-payers 128 --payer-account-balance 10 --send-fanout 2 --send-interval 100 --staked-identity-file config/bootstrap-validator/identity.json
```

### Run with saving created payers (on testnet, mainnet)

For mainnet and even testnet it is desirable to save created payer accounts.
This is achieved by the tool by first creating accounts and saving it to file `accounts.json`:

```rust
solana-rate-latency-tool -ut --authority "funder.json" --validate-accounts write-accounts --accounts-file accounts.json --num-payers 8 --payer-account-balance 1
```

And later sending transactions using generated accounts:

```rust
TOOL="/solana-rate-latency-tool"
FUNDER="funder.json"
IDENTITY="validator_identity.json" # for staked connection
DURATION=600

$TOOL -ut --authority $FUNDER --validate-accounts read-accounts-run  --accounts-file accounts.json --staked-identity-file $IDENTITY --send-interval 50 --duration $DURATION --compute-unit-price 10 --yellowstone-url "http://api.testnet.solana.com" --send-fanout $FANOUT  --output-csv-file out.csv yellowstone-leader-tracker "http://api.testnet.solana.com"  2> err.txt
```

### How to analyze the results

The result of the execution is file specified by `--output-csv-file`. This file has csv format and might be analyzed elsewhere.

### How to setup local validator with geyser plugin (yellostone)

For geyser plugin to work with validator it is important that versions of rust match.
To build yellostone with agave from master, I use this branch https://github.com/KirillLykov/yellowstone-grpc/tree/klykov/update-to-agave-master.

When running validator, you need to add one additional cla: ` --geyser-plugin-config yellowstone-grpc/yellowstone-grpc-geyser/config.json`.
The config file contains path to the `libyellowstone_grpc_geyser.so` file, check that it is correct.
Beside of that, change the option `"replay_stored_slots"` because by default it is 0.
